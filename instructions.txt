Instructions for PEAK6 DevOps Test

Given the attached app.py, please do the following:
1. Write a Dockerfile to package this flask Application as a container.
2. Write the necessary kubernetes manifests to deploy this container as a web application
3. Incorporate a dummy URL this application would respond on.

The output of this test would be a zip containing a Dockerfile and a set of yaml files.

NOTE: Treat this as introducing a new application into an already existing Kubernetes cluster that already has a number of other web applications already deployed. The Kubernetes files should be designed with Production quality, High Availability, and Scalability in mind.
